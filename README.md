# WiFi-Wizard-2.0
Warning! using this on someone elses wifi without their permission is illegal and falls under U.S. data theft classification for misdemeanors. A quick script to borrow your own wifi when you forget your password. Please give credit and mention me if borrowed/forked/etc.

#Instructions
1. change directory. For this example, I downloaded the wifi wizard script directly to the desktop.
2. open a terminal and type: cd Desktop
3. type the name of the wizard script: sudo sh WifiWizard.sh
4. when prompted, type in the device name on the screen that you would like to use: wlan0
5. Step 4 is usually wlan0 in most cases, however it is sometimes wlan0mon or eth0. To check this, the device name should be on your screen. Copy and Paste as needed.
